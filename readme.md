# Terminal I Ching

A command-line tool to consult the I Ching (Book of Changes).

## ðŸŒ± How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:AndrewJamesBarker/iching-terminal.git
   cd iching-terminal
   ```

2. **Run the program from /iching-terminal dir**

   ```bash
   python3 -m iching

   ```

When you ask a question, a hexagram is formed by simulating three coin tosses for each of the six lines. Each toss yields either 2 (tails) or 3 (heads), and the sum of the three values determines the line: an odd total creates a solid yang line (âšŠ), while an even total creates a broken yin line (âš‹).

## ðŸ“¦ Structure

* `main.py` â€“ Program entry point
* `iching/` â€“ Game logic and data
* `assets/json/hexagrams_full.json` â€“ Full I Ching hexagram dataset as a json object.
